# wallets

## Installation

To install the project we recommend that you use NVM and install the node version defined in `.nvmrc`

Once you have that in place, you can install the dependencies with npm through

`npm i`

## BasicPayments - Service

This is a minimum project that will serve as a guide to help students to do the rest of the integration

### Start process

To start the process, after you installed the dependencies and deployed the smart contracts to kovan, you can run

`npm start`

keep in mind that you should have everything in config set before that.

### Available endpoints

The following endpoints are available:

- Create wallet: POST /wallet - No body 
- Get wallets: GET /wallet
- Get wallet: GET /wallet/:id:
- Deposit ethers into the Smart contract: POST /deposit - Body params: senderId(integer), amountInEthers(string)
- Get deposit receipt: GET /deposit/:txHash:
